                <p>Hi! I'm Emiliano Ramirez and I'm a 19 year old developer. Not really sure what kind of developer 
                yet as I am still learning but what I am sure of is that I like developing. I am currently enrolled in 
                the Computer Science program at California State University of Northridge. I decided to start creating my 
                own projects in hopes of getting real world experience in both the game dev and web dev fields. Although 
                I have worked by myself on all of my personal projects, I enjoy working with others as well and do so a lot 
                while working on school projects.<a href="https://github.com/black112301/Emilianoramirez" target="_blank"> View the repository here.</a>

                <div class="dl-wrap">
                    Check out my resume!

                <p>Tonchi is a game I made with Unity based on my cat, Tonchi. Credits for the sound effects goes to <a href="https://soundbible.com/" target="_blank">soundbible.com</a> 
                . Everything else from the programming and art to the design and music was made by me. Developing this game has taught 
                me not only the process of making a game but also sticking through with a project until the end and deploying it.

                <p>I've always liked the idea of making my own website to host my games so after making Tonchi I decided to take on web dev to accomplish this goal while 
                learning web devovelopment at the same time. Also being a fan of speedrunning, I added a section dedicated to that where users can submit their own personal 
                best times(of course I rank number 1 always :D). Although it's only my friends and I using the using the site, I still found it to be a great learning experience 
                as I got to learn html, css, js, and even a little nodejs for the backend.
